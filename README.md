# agecalc-cpp (Work in Progress & Incomplete)

<!-- * * An age-calculation program with a custom made algorithm, up to the days in accuracy. An alternative version of [this](https://github.com/a-blob/age-calculator) but made with C++ and with OOP.  -->
<!-- * The algorithm is highly experimental. There may be errors in calculation. -->
